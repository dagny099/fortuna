# Today’s goals to “work smarter”:
1. ensure I have a local testing environment for my site.
2. deploy the working site to GitHub pages.
3. change the URL to be “barbhs.com”. Follow these steps. 

## Step 1. Installed Jekyll & Co.
* Install Ruby
* Install Bundler
* Install Jekyll
Note: Gems are dependencies, specified (somehow) by Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
