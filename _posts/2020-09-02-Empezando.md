# Today’s goals to “work smarter”:
1. follow GitHub Learning Lab tutorial to start my page
2. ensure I have a local testing environment for my site
3. deploy the working site to GitHub pages.
4. change the URL to be “barbhs.com”. Follow these steps. 

## Step 1. Learning Lab!
Thank you, GitHub Training Team :)

## Step 2. Installed Jekyll & Co.
* Install Ruby
* Install Bundler
* Install Jekyll
Note: Gems are dependencies, specified (somehow) by Gemfile and Gemfile.lock  


## Step 3.
